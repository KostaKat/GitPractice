Submodules

it is a nested git repo in another repo

1. make a new dir for the nested repo
2. go into that folder and do git submodule add url
the contents of this are not stored in our parent repository
this is stored in the .gitsubmodule

when you when you fork a project with submodules they won't populate the submodules

to downlaod these you can use git submodule updatw --init --reccursivly

you could do this also by git clone --recurse-submodules url

submodules are always checkout on a specific commit
