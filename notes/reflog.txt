Reflow

-logs gits every movement of a head pointers

Perfect use for reflog is if you accendenly delete commits

for example you use git reset, you could get them back
1. use git reflog
2. you can then make a branch having it start from the delete commit undoing the lost commits

for example you delete a branch
you could do the same thing in this case!
