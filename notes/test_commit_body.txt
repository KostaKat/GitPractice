This is a test file to show case the new thing that I learned. I didn't know that you could make commits with messages with a subject and body.

The following is what I learned how to structure my commit messages:
Subject = concise summary of what happened

Body = more detailed explanation
     - What is now different than before?
     - What's the reason for the change?
     - Is there anything to out for / anything particularly remarkable

Now I will make another commit to solidify this learning
