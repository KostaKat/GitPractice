Search and Find

1. by date  use --before / --after
2. by message --grep
3. by author --author
4. by file --<filename>
5. by branch <branch>


example, search if commits after a certain date
git log --after ="2021-7-21"

example between a date
git log --after ="2021-7-21" --before "2023-3-22"

 example, looking for a certain message
git log --grep = "blah", furthermore you could use regular expressions with grep
example, looking for a certain author
git log --author="smith"

example, looking for files
git log --README.md

example, by branch

git feature/login..main, the feature/login is the branch that you are currently in and the dot dot main will show you the changes in main but not in your current brach

you could combine all of these together
